### Reinforcement Learning Project (Pacman and Gridworld)

This project involved implementing fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms, including Value Iteration, Q-Learning, and Approximate Q-Learning. I developed agents that learned optimal policies through interaction with various environments such as Gridworld, Crawler, and Pacman. Key tasks included:

- Implemented **Value Iteration** and **Asynchronous Value Iteration** for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
- Built **Q-Learning agents** to learn from experience without a model.
- Applied **epsilon-greedy** exploration strategies.
- Tuned parameters to influence policy behaviors in complex environments like the BridgeGrid and DiscountGrid.
- Extended to **Approximate Q-Learning**, enabling scalable learning using feature-based representations.
- Tested and validated agents using a custom autograder, achieving high win rates in Pacman simulations.

The project was adapted from UC Berkeleyâ€™s CS188 and completed as part of ASU's CSE 471 course.
